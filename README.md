# vaccination-exercise

Solita Dev Academy exercise. 

> https://vaccine-exercise-tn.herokuapp.com/

Client was made using create-react-app typescript template and styled using material-ui.

Server is a node.js typescript application that uses express and mongoose + other smaller packages.

ESLint is utilized in both client and server side + Tests use Jest.

MongoDB database.

## About the exercise

Make a web application for presenting some interesting data about the vaccinations.

- The Orders are in different files named by the manufacturer of a vaccine.
- Injections must be used in 30 days after the arrival of the bottle.
- [name].source "Zerpfy"|"Antiqua"|"SolarBuddhica"
- The source file has one json item per line.

### Features from list of interesting things

For given day like 2021-04-12T11:10:06

* How many orders and vaccines have arrived total? ✅
* How many of the vaccinations have been used? ✅
* How many orders/vaccines per producer? ✅
* How many bottles have expired on the given day (remember a bottle expires 30 days after arrival) ✅
* How many vaccines expired before the usage -> remember to decrease used injections from the expired bottle ✅
* How many vaccines are left to use? ✅
* How many vaccines are going to expire in the next 10 days? ✅

## Running locally

### Database

This application uses MongoDB for database.

I used MongoDB Atlas but if you have MongoDB installed locally you can also you that.

Two databases have to be created:
1. vaccines (for main application)
2. vaccines-test (for running api tests)

### .ENV

Create .env file to the root of the server folder.

```
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise $ cd server
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise/server $ touch .env
```

Environment variables needed:
```
PORT=3001
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>/vaccines?retryWrites=true&w=majority

TEST_DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>/vaccines-test?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

⚠️ APPLICATION WON'T START IF DATABASE_URL IS MISSING ⚠️

### Install

To install all the dependencies for both client and server.

This is done from root of the project folder.

```
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise $ npm run install:both
```

To install separately.

```
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise $ cd server
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise/server $ npm install
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise/server $ cd ../client
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise/client $ npm install
```

### Build

To build both the client and the server side of the application.

```
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise $ npm run build:both
```

To build separately.

```
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise $ cd server
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise/server $ npm run tsc
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise/server $ cd ../client
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise/client $ npm run build
```

### Test

Currently only the server side of this application has tests.

```
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise $ cd server
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise/server $ npm run tsc
```

And of course for the api tests to work, you have to add TEST_DATABASE_URL variable to your .env 

### Before running

Before running the application you have initialize the database with order and vaccination data.

To initialize the database you can use:
1. [mongoimport](https://docs.mongodb.com/database-tools/mongoimport/)
2. [mongodb compass](https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/current/import-export/)
3. db-init script

Running db-init script:

```
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise $ cd server
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise/server $ npm run db-init
```

This script initializes the database with data only if it's empty. To reinitialize the database you have to manually delete all the collections in the database(orders and vaccinations).

### Run

Running the built version of the app:

```
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise $ cd server
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise/server $ npm start
```

Running the development version of the server:

```
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise $ cd server
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise/server $ npm run dev
```

Running in development version of the client:

```
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise $ cd client
~/<YOUR_PATH>/vaccine-exercise/server $ npm start
```

## API
